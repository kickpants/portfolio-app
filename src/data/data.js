    created/automatically assigned to available lockers. Automatically generated emails alert the customer of their order status and include their numerical \
    and QR access codes. It also keeps track of the status of each locker through a JavaScript-based interactive page and saves past orders separately.\
    no orders are present in the database (say, overnight), there is no charge.\
    As a full stack developer for this project, I worked on the input form UI, JavaScript interactive UI, and managing the AWS database. \
    As the Project Manager, meetings were conducted weekly to update the client on the projectâ€™s progress, and meetings were coordinated with the client and \
    librarians to receive and implement feedback on the design. \
    The frontend of the web app was created with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, while the backend consisted of PHP, AJAX, and MySQL to interact with the database.",

    "Automated Smart Shutter System",
    "A panel of plantation shutters is remotely/automatically adjusted \
    using an SG90 servo motor attached to a shutter axis. The angle of \
    the shutter blades is dependent on the light and heat levels inside \
    and outside. For example, to prevent the inside of the house from \
    heating up during hot weather, the blinds will automatically shut.",
    "The angle of a section of plantation shutters is modulated based on \
    input from four total sensors: two light sensors, and two temperature sensors. \
    these four sensors, plus the SG90 servo and a keypad are connected to a central \
    microprocessor, an MSP430 launchpad. A program written in C++ (using arduino libraries) \
    reads inputs from the sensors to automatically control the angle of the shutters, which \
    will typically try to open when it is light out, but will close over time if the inside \
    is warming up. Otherwise, there is a manual mode which allows the user either set the \
    blinds to open or closed.",

    this neural network to find out.",
    "This program, created using MATLAB, was a proof of concept for possible future Computer Vision \
    related projects. An R-CNN is trained by being fed several normal and augmented ground truth photos for training, and then \
    tested by having it pin the cat on unlabeled photos. Using the trained R-CNN, the program will attempt to label the area, \
    if such an area exists, which mostly resembles a cat. Along with this label will be a confidence score which reflects \
    how much the labeled area resembles a cat.",

    a song title as an arguement. The song title is processed and used to search youtube's API. The returned URL's audio is then \
    downloaded and formatted to play over the voice channel. A queueing feature with skipping was also implemented by using an asynchronous queue, \
    and keeping track of the queue's size from the play command. Once the queue is exhausted, the bot will wait a moment in case there are \
    any more requests, and then automatically leave the channel. For more information, view this project on GitHub!",
